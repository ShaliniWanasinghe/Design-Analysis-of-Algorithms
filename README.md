# Sorting Algorithms in MATLAB

This folder contains MATLAB implementations of common sorting algorithms. Each script demonstrates the logic of sorting a numeric array using a different approach.

## üìå Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort**  
  Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

- **Selection Sort**  
  Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and places it in the correct position.

- **Merge Sort**  
  A recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits and merges arrays in sorted order.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Selects a pivot and partitions the array into subarrays, recursively sorting them.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Open any `.m` file (e.g., `bubble_sort.m`, `quick_sort.m`) in MATLAB.
2. Modify the input array inside the script or pass it as a function argument.
3. Run the script to see the sorted output.
