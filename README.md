# Searching Algorithms in MATLAB

This folder contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental searching algorithms i learned in my Practices. These scripts demonstrate how different searching techniques can be applied to locate elements in arrays.

## üìå Algorithms Included

- **Linear Search**  
  A basic search method that traverses each element sequentially until the target is found.

- **Binary Search**  
  An efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Open any of the `.m` files (e.g., `linear_search.m`, `binary_search.m`) in MATLAB.
2. Run the script and follow input prompts or edit the script to change the input array and search key.
3. Observe the output, which typically includes the index of the found item or a message indicating it's not present.
